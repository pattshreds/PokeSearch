<h3>To make this application I created 4 pages; each with their own html, js, and css files. </h3> <br> My first step in creating this was to make the main page with the main feature I had planned from the start. I began by designing the html of the page (not what you see now, very basic just to get a base layout), then I worked on the functionality, and finally the styling. <br> After the first page was created and working properly, I implemented my second feature, which is the Compare Pokémon page which added a second modal to the screen to compare two pokémon side-by-side. Once that was finished I spent some time thinking about what else I wanted to add which ended up being the About page, the Dev page, and a search function for all of the berries in the game.

No installation necessary to run this app.

Current unsolved problems:
<ul>
<li>Search bar will only perform one search, then the app needs to be refreshed to search again.</li>
  <li>Animation isn't as responsive as I want it to be.</li>
  </ul>
