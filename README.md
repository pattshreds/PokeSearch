<h3>To make this application I created 4 pages; each with their own HTML, JS, and CSS files. </h3> <br />
My first step in creating this was to make the main page with the main feature I had planned from the start which is the Pokedex with a cover that opens on page load. I began by structuring the html of the index.html page (not what you see now, very basic just to get a framework), then I worked on the JS functionality, and finally the styling. <br /> <br />
After the first page was created and working properly, I implemented my second feature, which is the Compare Pokémon page which added a second modal to the screen to compare two pokémon side-by-side. Once that was finished I spent some time thinking about what else I wanted to add which ended up being the About page and a page with a search function for all of the berries in the game.

<h2>Current unsolved problems:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><s>Search bar will only perform one search, then the app needs to be refreshed to search again.</s></li>
  <li><s>Animation isn't as responsive as I want it to be.</s></li>
  <li><s>Switch deployment host from GitHub Pages to AWS Amplify</s></li>
  <li>Fix pokedex cover animation in mobile view.</li>
  <li>Fix z-index issue on compare.html in mobile view.</li>
  <li>Figure out how to change placeholder text on index.html in search textbox depending on viewport size.</li>
  <li>Fix z-index issue and center modal on berries.html</li>
  <li>Improve file structure with seperate directories for JS, HTML, CSS and images.</li>
</ul>
