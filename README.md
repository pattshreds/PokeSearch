# pokedex_app
To make this applicatin I created 4 pages, each with their own html, js, and css files. My first step in creating this was to make the main page with the main feature I had planned from the start. I began by designing the html of the page (not what you see now, very basic just to get a base layout), then worked on the functionality, and finally the styling. After the first page was created and working properly, I implemented my second feature, which is the Compare Pokémon page which added a second modal to compare two Pokémon. Once that was finished I spent some time thinking about what else I wanted to add, which ended up being and About the Dev page, and a search function for all of the berries in the game.

Link to the App:

No installation necessary to run this app.

Current unsolved problems:
1.Search bar will only perform one search, then the app needs to be refreshed to search again.
2.Animation isn't as responsive as I want it to be.
